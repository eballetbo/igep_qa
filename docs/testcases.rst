Test Cases
==========

A test case is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will
determine whether an application or system is working correctly. It may take
many test cases to determine that a software program or system is considered
sufficiently scrutinized to be released. Test cases are often referred to as
test scripts, particularly when written. Written test cases are usually
collected into test suites.
