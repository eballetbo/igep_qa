Test Suites
===========

A Test Suite, less commonly known as a validation suite, is a collection of
test cases that are intended to be used to test something to show that it has
some specified set of behaviours. A test suite often contains detailed
instructions or goals for each collection of test cases and information on the
system configuration to be used during testing. A group of test cases may also
contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions of the following tests.
